# LETscore
## Masters Project 

A program for measuring the Linear Energy Transfer (LET) of secondary protons in a water phantom for the purpose of proton therapy treatment planning.

Uses the [GEANT4 toolkit](https://geant4.web.cern.ch) developed by CERN.

Work was carried out over the course of a year in collaboration with *Project Partner*, whilst the report was written individually and represents the work carried out in the second semester.
